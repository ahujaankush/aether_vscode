# Aether Theme for Visual Studio Code
This repo contains my custom vscode theme using a slightly modified version of the [aether color scheme](https://github.com/ilham25/dotfiles-openbox).

![Showcase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyxodan/aether_vscode/main/showcase.PNG)

## Installation
Copy the 'pyxodan.aether-xxx' (xxx stands for the current version) folder into your vscode extension directory.
Restart vscode if an instance is running and the theme should be visible under your installed extensions.
