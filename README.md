# aether_vscode
This repo contains my custom vscode theme using a slightly modified version of the aether color scheme.

## Installation
Copy the 'pyxodan.aether-***' folder into your vscode extension directory.
Restart vscode if a instance is running and the theme should be visible under your installed extensions.
